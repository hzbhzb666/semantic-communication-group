# semantic-communication-group
A WeChat discussion group on semantic communication and task oriented communication.
我新建了一个用来讨论语义通信、面向任务通信的微信群，你可以添加我的微信号（bdhzb1997），之后我会邀请你进群。群内成员都对语义通信的研究颇感兴趣，欢迎大家的加入。

As a new communication technology and research direction, semantic communication has received extensive attention, but it is not easy for those of us who have no relevant foundation to carry out. At present, I have not found an open communication group related to semantic communication, so I have created a new WeChat group dedicated to discussing semantic communication and task oriented communication. You can add my WeChat (bdhzb1997), and then I will invite you to join the group. Members of the group are interested in the research of semantic communication, and welcome to join.
